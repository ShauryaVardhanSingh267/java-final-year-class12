# java-final-year-class12  

This repository contains my Java programs created during **ISC Class 12 Computer Science**.  
The focus this year was on mastering **advanced programming concepts, data structures, algorithms, and file handling** while preparing for the ISC board examinations.  

## Topics Covered  

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Interfaces and abstract classes  
- Method overloading & overriding  
- Packages and access modifiers  

### Data Structures & Algorithms  
- Arrays (1D & 2D)  
- Strings and character operations  
- Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists  
- Recursion  

### Algorithms  
- Searching (Linear, Binary)  
- Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick)  
- Basics of time complexity  

### File Handling  
- Reading and writing text files in Java  
- File I/O using streams  

### Practical Applications  
- ISC board exam-style programs  
- Logic-based problem solving  
- Algorithm implementation in Java
